* TODO Nesterov Acceleration for Prox
- Get min and max eigenvalues from Q matrix in quadratic x.TQx + c.T problems. 
- Could make it an option to the Prox Method or a new method - should probably be included in Prox function
- Email from Iyer about other acceleration method

* TODO Fix all Linear Algebra Functions - can see Iyer's code

* TODO Need test functions for lots of Prox functions - Prox ops and proj functions

* TODO One more problem from Iyer to code up for Prox too

* TODO Readme describing the library, possibly uses, example problems, etc

* TODO Maybe change to use 1D vectors where appropriate - good exercise for actuality learning some numpy

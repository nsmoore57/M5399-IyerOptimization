* TODO Fix all Linear Algebra Functions - can see Iyer's code

* TODO Need test functions for lots of Prox functions - Prox ops and proj functions

* TODO One more problem from Iyer to code up for Prox too
  
* TODO Readme describing the library, possibly uses, example problems, etc
  
* TODO Maybe change to use 1D vectors where appropriate - good exercise for actually learning some numpy
